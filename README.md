# PS6-Research-of-Sleep-Efficiency

## Information of the dataset sleep efficiency.

The dataset was downloaded from kaggle. The dataset contains information about a group of test subjects and their sleep patterns. Each test subject is identified by a unique 'Subject ID' and their age and gender are also recorded. The 'Bedtime' and 'Wakeup time' features indicate when each subject goes to bed and wakes up each day, and the 'Sleep duration' feature records the total amount of time each subject slept in hours. The 'Sleep efficiency' feature is a measure of the proportion of time spent in bed that is actually spent asleep. The 'REM sleep percentage', 'Deep sleep percentage', and 'Light sleep percentage' features indicate the amount of time each subject spent in each stage of sleep. The 'Awakenings' feature records the number of times each subject wakes up during the night. Additionally, the dataset includes information about each subject's caffeine and alcohol consumption in the 24 hours prior to bedtime, their smoking status, and their exercise frequency.

## Widgets and Panels

* The first histogram graph shows the counts of people's sleep efficiency by defining the server logic to draw a histogram.
* The second plot graph shows the relationship between sleep efficiency and percentage of deep sleep by gender. The number of observation is 452 which are all the participants in the dataset. The plot is also able to show the trend of the relationship. Users could interact with the plot by selecting genders and view the trend.
* The third table calculates the average sleep efficicency according to groups such as gender or smoking status. With the table, we could see people who smoke slihgtly have less average sleep efficiency compare to people who do not smoke. Users could interact with the table by selecting two groups which are gender or smoking status.
